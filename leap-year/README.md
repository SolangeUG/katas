## Leap Year

Write a function that returns **`true`** or **`false`** depending on whether its input integer is a **leap year** or not.

The following rules determine if an integer is a leap year:

- It is **not** a leap year if it is **not divisible** by 4.
- It is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.
- It is a leap year if it is divisible by 400.
- It is **not** a leap year if it is divisible by 100 but **not** by 400.

### For example:

- 1997 is **not** a leap year (not divisible by 4).
- 1996 is a leap year (divisible by 4).
- 1600 is a leap year (divisible by 400).
- 1800 is **not** a leap year (divisible by 4, divisible by 100, NOT divisible by 400).
